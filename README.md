- I have scraped data of Github Users from London with more than 500 followers along with their repositories(atmost 500) using Jupyter Notebook in VScode by exctracting the details from the Json responses of the corresponding Github API.
- Kunal Kushwaha who joined github comparatively later than the other top users(in terms of followers) stands second with 30k followers; with the third user with just 1k followers. This difference was surprising.
- Just being late to a domain does not mean you can not excel in it; instead quality content which provides value helps in excelling in any domain
